Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4: Performing Initialization Phase 1.
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4: Lossless Initialization WITHOUT batteries accomTime Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4:  x0 within limits. Initialization successful. Proceeding to solving for the full optimization problem.
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4:  Now solving for the real deal.
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4: Projected savings in substation power flow by using batteries: 34.949680 percent.
a = 4:  Oh no!Time Period = 1, Converged in 6 macro-iterations!
.
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4:  Oh no! x0_NoLoss(193) < lb(193) as -0.001548 < -0.001548.
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4: x0_NoLoss within limits anyway? More like MATLAB stupid? Phase 1 of Initialization successful. Proceeding to Phase 2 of Initialization.
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4: Performing Initialization Phase 2
Time Period = 1, macroItr = 6 and Area = 4: Lossless Initialization WITH batteries accomplished.
